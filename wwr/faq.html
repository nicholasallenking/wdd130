                <h2>Answers</h2>
                <p>1) As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. 
                    To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. 
                    The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). 
                    Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. 
                    Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                    2) We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.
                    We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). 
                    You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
