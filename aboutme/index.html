    <h2>Nick</h2>
        <p>My name is Nicholas King. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, in February, 1998. As a BYU-I student, I
        am currently living in Rexburg, Idaho as a student.
        I have been a ember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all of my life, having been baptized when
        I was 8. I served a Service Mission in my home town of Las Vegas.
        <p>I am taking this course as part of my I.T. degree and am looking forard into understanding the development and
        maintenance of websites. I am planning on going into Cybersecurity for my career. 
        I like how many options are open at BYU-I, giving me multiple avenues to choose. I am hoping to use the
        information I am learning in this course to help me prepare for my work in the security sector.</p>
        <p>As a personal detail I could share, is that I enjoy multiple hobbies, including: HAM radio, model
        building, model painting, gaming, and cooking.</p>
