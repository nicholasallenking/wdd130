                <h2>The Right Tools</h2>
                <p>Many students, new and experienced, are seen with only the most basic of cooking tools like a
                    frying pan, spatula, and a sauce pot.
                    While many parents of prospective students may help them prepare for their careers in further
                    education, there are still much for these fresh cooks
                    need to know before they can truly make their kitchens tue cooking spaces. While there are many
                    different situations for students, some have full
                    cooking spaces while others may only have a corner in their dorms. These situations all will
                    determine what students will consider adding to their
                    arsenal of appliances and tools, which this site will seek to provide for each kind of student.
                    Ranging form affordable and compact, the appliances and tools
                    that will be featured here wil provide insights for students who may want to improve their
                    cooking quality while not breaking the bank. The appliances featured here
                    will provide differing options for different budgets, though some appliances may be good to
                    consider as decent investments for students down the line.

                <h2>Low Cost</h2>
                <p>Starting with the Low Budget options, a great starting appliance would be a Toaster Oven. Many current models give ample provide decent options for<br>
                    for most meals while not taking too much space, while also having additional features, like air frying. Just as you should pay attention to your<br>
                    budget, consider your available space for storage.
                </p>
                <h2>Mid-to-High Cost</h2>
                <p>A more mid-to-higher expensive appliance that is suggested is a multi-cooker. I say mid-to-higher because the cost depends on which brand<br>
                    or model you choose. One of the more popular brads out there is the Instant Pot, which gives their users many options to cook with, including <br>
                    pressure-cooking, slow-cooking, sauteing, and prebuilt options for cooking different kinds of foods, like poultry or rice. Some models,<br> if you're
                    willing to pay the price, can include features such as sous vide or even air frying with additional accessories. <br>
                    Remember, keep track of your space. Don't get an appliance you can't store. Luckily, many of these kinds of appliances are fairly compact.
