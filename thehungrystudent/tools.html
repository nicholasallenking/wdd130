                    <h2>The Right Tools</h2>
                    <p>Many students, new and experienced, are seen with only the most basic of cooking tools like a frying pan, spatula, and a sauce pot.
                        While many parents of prospective students may help them prepare for their careers in further education, there are still much for these fresh cooks
                        need to know before they can truly make their kitchens tue cooking spaces. While there are many different situations for students, some have full 
                        cooking spaces while others may only have a corner in their dorms. These situations all will determine what students will consider adding to their 
                        arsenal of appliances and tools, which this site will seek to provide for each kind of student. Ranging form affordable and compact, the appliances and tools
                        that will be featured here wil provide insights for students who may want to improve their cooking quality while not breaking the bank. The appliances featured here
                        will provide differing options for different budgets, though some appliances may be good to consider as decent investments for students down the line.
