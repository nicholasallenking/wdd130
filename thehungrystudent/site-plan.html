      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>“I am a current college student.
        I have had experience in cooking at home and in catering.
        I have learned a lot about budgeting and cooking as a student, as well as techniques and methods for cooking in college.
        I have tried many tools and appliances in the kitchen, giving me insights into what works and doesn’t with the average student.
        Think back to when you were in college or living on your own. Did you struggle to make good meals on a budget? Did you know about the tools that could have helped you throughout your college years? As I have gone through college myself, I’ve learned a lot about the needs of a hungry college student. I want to create a website with guides, lists, and tools that students can use to improve their cooking on any budget. 
        </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site’s intended audience is any college student of most common walks of life. 
          Whether they are experienced in cooking or have never picked up a stirring spoon, this site is intended for providing basic resources for college students searching for appropriate tools, appliances, and all other needs for eating in college life. 
          From dorms to off-campus housing, this site seeks to aid any student’s needs when they want to make their own meals. 
          From those on a strict budget to those who have extra funds for the more indulgent types, this site will help students find what they need.

        The initial issues students will find when it comes to food will be budgeting and understanding what tools work well. Even seasoned students may be unused to or 
        completely unaware of what appliances and tools can be useful even in limited living spaces such as dormitories. This website's main goal is to show any student 
        the different tools, techniques, and methods they can implement to not only increase their standard of meals in terms of budget but also quality. This site will 
        provide insights into what appliances could be considered as well as how to make cost-efficient and genuinely good food, hopefully pulling students from having to 
        endure long weeks on instant noodles and boring oatmeal. As students will need to be smart about their spending, with high costs and loans rising each year, food 
        shouldn’t be another stress to pile on during these important years. Unlike other sites that provide similar information, this site’s goal is to provide ‘everything’ 
        the hungry student needs, not just recipes or just neat ideas. This site is a one-stop-shop for the needs of prospective or experienced students.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest stresses students will encounter in college is budgeting. There are many horror stories relating to students struggling to get good meals due to a 
        lack of funds. With the rising prices of tuition and food costs, students will most likely be struggling to get good meals. These issues likely lead students to spend 
        their money on presumably ‘good’ foods that are dirt cheap, such as instant ramen or oatmeal. While these foods aren’t poor choices for occasionally quick meals or snacks, 
        they aren’t nearly suggestable for replacing most meals. The effects on one’s health these foods can have is less than desirable. On the other side of this spectrum, some 
        students may have some extra money to spare for food, but they spend it on fast food, which isn’t as suggestable either. With the rising prices and lack of quality found 
        in many fast foods, the lacking health benefits can degrade a student’s mental and physical well-being,  while incrementally growing costs can drain the bank faster than 
        they may realize. To counteract the issues on either side of this issue, home cooking can be an effective method to not only save students money but improve and manage their
        health better.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Many students, new and experienced, are seen with only the most basic of cooking tools like a frying pan, spatula, and a sauce pot. While many parents of prospective students 
        may help them prepare for their careers in further education, there is still much many of these fresh cooks need to know before their can truly make their kitchens true cooking spaces. 
        While there are many different situations for students, some have full spaces for cooking while some may only have a corner in their dorm. These situations all will determine what 
        students will consider adding to their arsenal of appliances and tools, which this site will seek to provide for each kind of student. Ranging from affordable and compact, the 
        appliances and tools that will be featured here will provide insights for students who may want to improve their cooking quality while not breaking the bank. The appliances featured 
        here will provide different options for different budgets, though some appliances may be good to consider as decent investments for students down the line.
