                <h2>The Student Food Crisis</h2>
                <p>The initial issues students will find when it comes to food will be budgeting and understanding
                    what tools work well.
                    Even seasoned students may be unused to or completely unaware of what appliances and tools can
                    be useful even in limited living spaces such as dormitories.
                    This website's main goal is to show any student the different tools, techniques, and methods
                    they can implement to not only increase their standard of meals in
                    terms of budget but also quality. This site will provide insights into what appliances could be
                    considered as well as how to make cost-efficient and genuinely
                    good food, hopefully pulling students from having to endure long weeks on instant noodles and
                    boring oatmeal. As students will need to be smart about their
                    spending, with high costs and loans rising each year, food shouldn’t be another stress to pile
                    on during these important years.
                    Unlike other sites that provide similar information, this site’s goal is to provide ‘everything’
                    the hungry student needs, not just recipes or neat ideas.
                    This site is a one-stop-shop for the needs of prospective or experienced students.</p>
