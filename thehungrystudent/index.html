                    <h2> The Student Food Crisis</h2>
                    <p>The initial issues students will find when it comes to food will be budgeting and understanding
                        what tools work well.
                        Even seasoned students may be unused to or completely unaware of what appliances and tools can
                        be useful even in limited living spaces such as dormitories.
                        This website's main goal is to show any student the different tools, techniques, and methods
                        they can implement to not only increase their standard of meals in
                        terms of budget but also quality. This site will provide insights into what appliances could be
                        considered as well as how to make cost-efficient and genuinely
                        good food, hopefully pulling students from having to endure long weeks on instant noodles and
                        boring oatmeal. As students will need to be smart about their
                        spending, with high costs and loans rising each year, food shouldn’t be another stress to pile
                        on during these important years.
                        Unlike other sites that provide similar information, this site’s goal is to provide ‘everything’
                        the hungry student needs, not just recipes or just neat ideas.
                        This site is a one-stop-shop for the needs of prospective or experienced students.</p>
