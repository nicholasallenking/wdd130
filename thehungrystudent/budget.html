                    <h2>Staying in Your Budget</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest stresses students will encounter in college is budgeting. There are many horror stories relating to students struggling to get good
                        meals due to a lack of funds. With the rising prices of tuition and food costs, students will most likely be struggling to get good meals. These issues
                        likely lead students to spend thier money on presumebly 'good' foods tht are dirt cheap, such as instant ramen or oatmeal. While these food aren't
                        poor choices for occasionally quick meals or snack, theya ren't nearly suggestable for replacing most meals. The effects on one's health these foods can have
                        is less than desirable. On the other side of this spectrum, some students may have some extra money to spare for food, but they spend it on fast food, which
                        isn't as suggestable either. With the rising prices and lack of quality found in many fast foods, the lacking health benefits can degrade a student's 
                        mental and physical well-being, while incrementally growing costs can drain the bank faster than they may realize. To counteract the issues on either side
                         of the this problem, home cooking can be an effective method to not only save students money but also improve and manage their health better.

                    <h2>Budgeting Tips</h2>
                    <p>Avoid Buying for Convenience: Many popular choices students will go for is to buy frozen foods that can be heated up quickly. These foods are not much healthier than<br>
                        instant noodles or other convenient fast foods. If you want to buy frozen food, buy simple vegetables, fruits, and meats. These foods are versatile and far healthier<br>
                        while also giving you plentiful options to make bulk meals.<br>
