                <h2>Staying in Your Budget</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest stresses students will encounter in college is budgeting. There are many horror
                    stories relating to students struggling to get good
                    meals due to a lack of funds. With the rising prices of tuition and food costs, students will most
                    likely be struggling to get good meals. These issues
                    likely lead students to spend thier money on presumebly 'good' foods tht are dirt cheap, such as
                    instant ramen or oatmeal. While these food aren't
                    poor choices for occasionally quick meals or snack, theya ren't nearly suggestable for replacing
                    most meals. The effects on one's health these foods can have
                    is less than desirable. On the other side of this spectrum, some students may have some extra money
                    to spare for food, but they spend it on fast food, which
                    isn't as suggestable either. With the rising prices and lack of quality found in many fast foods,
                    the lacking health benefits can degrade a student's
                    mental and physical well-being, while incrementally growing costs can drain the bank faster than
                    they may realize. To counteract the issues on either side
                    of the this problem, home cooking can be an effective method to not only save students money but
                    also improve and manage their health better.</p>

                <h1>Budgeting Tips</h1>
                <h2>Avoid Buying for Convenience: </h2>
                <p>Many popular choices students will go for is to buy frozen foods that can be heated up quickly. These
                    foods are not much healthier than<br>
                    instant noodles or other convenient fast foods. If you want to buy frozen food, buy simple
                    vegetables, fruits, and meats. These foods are versatile and far healthier<br>
                    while also giving you plentiful options to make bulk meals.
                    <h2>Sale Hunt with flexability:</h2>
                    <p>While I wouldn't suggest carrying a pocket book full of coupons that only save you cents on the
                        dollar, I would suggest planning your meals ahead of time,<br>
                        while also checking your local stores for good deals on items you may use in your cooking. If
                        you plan to cook a stew, for example, but can't find beef at a good price<br>
                        consider switching to pork stew or chicken, which may have better prices while not altering the
                        meal too heavily. Most grocers nowadays will show when foods are discounted or
                        on sale with their online services.</p>
                    <h2>Make what you like:</h2>
                    <p>If you find a recipe that you really like and find it affordable, make it. Don't let others tease
                        you into thinking that making the same meals every week<br>
                        is something to be ashamed of. If variety is the spice of life, make two or three meals that can
                        satisfy you and make good leftovers. Finding that golden recipe<br>
                        that leaves you happy and satisfied not only will help prevent your health declinging from
                        malnutrition, you will also boost your mental state as you find joy in what you eat.</p>

                    <h1>Cooking Tips</h1>
                    <h2>Start Simple, Start Smart:</h2>
                    <p>If you're not experienced in cooking your own meals on your own, please start small and simple.
                        Even if it is something simple like scrambled eggs, do a little research
                        before<br> you accidently use a salad fork to stir your eggs in a non-stick pan (a real
                        experience I've seen from roommates)! Remember, keeping your tools in good
                        shape is just as important as cooking things correctly. If you have an oven, use it first as it
                        can be useful for cooking many easy meals.</p>
                    <h2>Your Freezer Is Your Friend:</h2>
                    <p>If you're lucky enough to live in a space that offers a refrigerator and freezer, you should
                        utilize the freezer space effectively. Frozen fruits, veggies, and meats
                        can provide you with options down the line. While having some pre-made meals can be useful as an
                        occasional deal, don't fill your limited space with junk.</p>
                    <h2>Bookmark Your Plans Efficiently:</h2>
                    <p>If you find recipes online that you like or want to try, by all means bookmark them, but do so
                        effectively. Most, if not all browsers, allow you to make sub-folders for<br>
                        for your bookmarks. To start, make a sub-folder for breakfasts, lunches, snacks/desserts, and
                        dinners. After those, you can expand even futher if you feel like it.<br>
                        Just be sure not to make too many folders where you will get lost in finding a specific recipe.
